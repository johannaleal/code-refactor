# code-refactor

## Description

In this project, I refactored code on an index.html page and on its associated style sheet. The code was refactored in the following ways:

* Added a concise, descriptive title element
* Converted non-semantic elements into semantic elements to improve code readability
* Verified that heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Added ALT tags to all images with corresponding descriptive text for accessibility
* Modified style sheet to reduce redundancy and improve logical flow
* Added comments to index.html page and style sheet to improve readability
